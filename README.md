## Getting Started  

This project demonstrates how to build and manage a ReactJS application for employment agreements, showcasing core features like:  
- CRUD operations for agreements.  
- Context API for state management.  
- Mock REST API with JSON Server.  
- Form validation and user-friendly navigation.

## Steps to Follow

Create a project with the above instructions and explain step by step
Here’s a step-by-step guide to implement the project :
---
1. Project Setup
Install ReactJS:
Run: npx create-react-app employment-agreement-management
Organize the structure:
Create directories: components, pages, services, context, styles, and tests.
---
2. UI Design and Implementation
Dashboard Component:
Display a list of agreements (Employee Name, Department, Position, Agreement Date) in a
table.
Use Material-UI or Bootstrap for styling.
View Agreement Component:
Create a detailed view showing all agreement fields for the selected agreement.
Create Agreement Form:
Use form controls (e.g., TextField or Input) for inputs like name, department, position, and date.
Add form validations (e.g., required fields).
Update Agreement Form:
Reuse the create form, preloading the data for editing.
Routing:
Use react-router-dom to navigate between components (/dashboard, /view/:id, /create,
/update/:id).
---
3. Integration with REST APIs
Mock REST API:
Set up JSON Server:
npm install -g json-server
Create db.json:
{
"agreements": [
{ "id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "department": "HR", "position": "Manager", "agreementDate":
"2023-01-01" }
]
}
Run server: json-server --watch db.json --port 5000.
Fetch Data:
Use axios for API calls.
Example API calls:
GET /agreements - Fetch all agreements.
GET /agreements/:id - Fetch specific agreement.
POST /agreements - Add new agreement.
PUT /agreements/:id - Update agreement.
Loading/Error Handling:
Use states (loading, error) to display spinners or error messages during API calls.
---
4. State Management
React Context API:
Create AgreementContext for managing global states like agreements, selectedAgreement, etc.
Provide the context to all components in App.js.
---
5. Unit Testing
Install Jest and React Testing Library:
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
Write Tests:
Test form validations:
Ensure fields are required.
Test invalid inputs (e.g., empty name).
Test API interactions using mocks.
Test state changes and rendering of components.
---
6. Documentation
README File:
Include instructions to set up the project:
npm install
npm start
Explain the project structure and usage of mock API.
Code Comments:
Add meaningful comments to functions and components.
---
7. Submission
Push the project to a GitHub repository.
Include screenshots/videos of:
Dashboard
View, Create, and Update forms. 
Run tests and add the test coverage report.
